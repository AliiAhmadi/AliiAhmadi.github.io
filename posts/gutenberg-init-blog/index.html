At the time I was rather interested in Node.js, so it seemed natural to use a framework rooted in that community.<p>By the time of my last post I'd become increasingly disinterested in Node.js and much more interested in Rust and its community. It was mostly procrastination, but I convinced myself that using a tool written in a language I didn't use often directly contributed to the paucity of posts here, so I finally decided to ditch Hexo.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><h2 id=replacement-criteria><a aria-label="Anchor link for: replacement-criteria" href=#replacement-criteria></a>Replacement Criteria</h2><p>Of course, I needed a suitable replacement. I wanted it to<ul><li>Be fast<li>Be flexible<li>Generate <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS</a> feeds<li>Support live reloading<li>Support <a href=http://commonmark.org/>Markdown</a></ul><p>Fast and flexible are nebulous requirements. Most static site generators are more than fast enough since I'm not generating a site with hundreds of pages (yet). My <a href=/posts/hexo-init-blog>early experience with Hexo</a> taught me that while having a bunch of features out of the box is nice flexibility is more important. I needed to be able to choose my own deployment mechanisms and structure my site the way I wanted to.<p>I don't personally use an RSS feed reader, but I know friends of mine do and they've asked me to support that (<a href=/rss.xml>here ya go</a>). I sure as heck didn't want to generate an RSS feed myself.<p>Live reloading and Markdown support were non-negotiable requirements. The write, build, and reload cycle is too tedious to forgo live reloading. I simply didn't want to use a markup language other than Markdown because writing it is effortless for me at this point.<h2 id=the-hunt><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-hunt" href=#the-hunt></a>The Hunt</h2><p>I <a href=https://www.staticgen.com/>surveyed the landscape</a>, but didn't find anything to my liking, so I procrastinated even more. Then I happened across an <a href=https://www.vincentprouillet.com/blog/introducing-tera/>article</a> linked from an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11507188">orange website</a> introducing <a href=https://github.com/Keats/tera>Tera</a>, a template engine in Rust. When I saw that the author drew inspiration from Python's <a href=http://jinja.pocoo.org/>Jinja2</a> templating library I got <em>really</em> excited.<p>I tried my hand at writing my own static site generator in Rust. I managed to get a rudimentary POC using Tera operational just in time for <a href=https://www.vincentprouillet.com/>Vincent Prouillet</a>, the author of Tera, to <a href=https://www.vincentprouillet.com/blog/announcing-gutenberg/>announce Gutenberg</a>. It met all my replacement criteria, used the templating engine I was interested in, and was written in Rust!<h2 id=building-my-new-site><a aria-label="Anchor link for: building-my-new-site" href=#building-my-new-site></a>Building My New Site</h2><p>Once I found Gutenberg I attacked fixing up my site with <a href="https://github.com/reillysiemens/tuckersiemens.com/graphs/contributors?from=2017-04-23&to=2017-06-14&type=c">vigor</a>. I wrote my own templates, learned a little <a href=http://sass-lang.com/>Sass</a>, and even managed to make a <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/commit/7c1cecb2112e087e2ffb45937bea29ebf81df01e>small contribution to Gutenberg</a>. Hexo made my site largely a black box, but now there isn't a line of the source I haven't touched.<p>As an added bonus, I took the redesign opportunity to ensure there's <strong>no JavaScript anywhere on this site</strong>, so this page renders exactly the same regardless of whether you're using a JavaScript blocker. In the future I may relax this constraint, but I'm happy with my decision so far and I was able to learn more about Flexbox and CSS3 as a result.<p>I also had time to add custom <a href=/404.html><strong>404 Not Found</strong></a> and <a href=/50x.html><strong>50x Server Error</strong></a> pages. If you're interested in more little details, you can find the source for the redesigned site on <a href=https://github.com/reillysiemens/tuckersiemens.com>GitHub</a>.<h2 id=credit-where-credit-is-due><a aria-label="Anchor link for: credit-where-credit-is-due" href=#credit-where-credit-is-due></a>Credit Where Credit Is Due</h2><p>This would not have been possible without Vincent's hard work on Tera and Gutenberg. I also borrowed a great deal from <a href=https://syaning.github.io/>Alex Sun</a>'s <a href=https://github.com/syaning/vida>vida</a> Jekyll theme in writing this site's Sass. I've learned a lot from both of them. Thanks!<h2 id=what-s-next><a aria-label="Anchor link for: what-s-next" href=#what-s-next></a>What's Next?</h2><p>This site is in a much better place than it was a year ago. I understand it better and I'm more motivated to continue working on it, so expect more posts!</article></main><footer><nav><a href=/>Home</a> ⬡ <a href=/posts>Posts</a> ⬡ <a href=/tags>Tags</a> ⬡ <a href=/contact>Contact</a></nav><p>© 2024 Ali Ahmadi ⬡ <a href=https://github.com/AliiAhmadi>Github</a></footer>
